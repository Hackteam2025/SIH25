# SIH25
we're building a voice ai conversational agent that has tools to visualize and generate graphs, clean data, provide key insights on the fly (in realtime)

## Installation
- we'll be using `uv` instead of pip for package installation

first create a virtual environment (box inside box) using 
1. `uv venv --python 3.11` then, 
2  activate via `source .venv/bin/activate` cmd and finally,
3. run `uv sync` to install deps

## DOCS
this folder contains different files, have a look if needed.

## DataOps
this contains all of the information required to perform E2E (end to end) 
- it also contains a README which contains information on how to use.
