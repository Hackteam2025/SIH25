# Phase 3: Voice AI - Ready for Testing 🎤

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All components of Phase 3 (Voice AI Migration to Pipecat React SDK) have been implemented and verified.

## 🔧 What Was Built

### Backend Components

1. **Voice Bot** (`sih25/VOICE_AI/pipecat_bot.py`)
   - Groq LLM integration for oceanographic conversations
   - Soniox STT for speech recognition (Hindi/English)
   - Sarvam AI TTS for voice synthesis (Hindi/English)
   - Daily.co WebRTC transport
   - Comprehensive logging with emoji markers

2. **API Endpoint** (`sih25/VOICE_AI/api.py`)
   - `/voice/connect` - Creates Daily room and meeting token
   - `/voice/disconnect` - Cleanup endpoint
   - `/voice/status` - Service health check
   - Fixed: Proper meeting token generation (not API key)

### Frontend Components

1. **Voice Chat Component** (`sih25/FRONTEND_REACT/src/components/voice/PipecatVoiceChat.tsx`)
   - Pipecat React SDK integration
   - Voice control buttons (Start, Mute, Language Switch, Stop)
   - Real-time status indicators
   - Comprehensive event logging for debugging
   - All RTVI events captured and logged

2. **Chat Interface Integration** (`sih25/FRONTEND_REACT/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`)
   - Voice component integrated
   - Transcript callbacks connected
   - Bot response callbacks connected

## 🔍 Debugging Features Added

### Frontend Logging (Browser Console)

When you open DevTools Console (F12), you'll see:

**Connection Flow:**
```
🎤 [Voice AI] Starting connection...
🌐 [Voice AI] Backend URL: http://localhost:8001
📞 [Voice AI] Calling /voice/connect...
🔄 [Pipecat] Transport state: authenticating
🔄 [Pipecat] Transport state: connecting
🎉 [Pipecat] User connected to Daily room
🤖 [Pipecat] Bot connected to room
✅ [Pipecat] Bot is ready for conversation!
✅ [Voice AI] Connected successfully!
```

**When Speaking:**
```
🎤 [User] Started speaking
🎤 [User] Stopped speaking
👤 [User Transcript]: { text: "hello", final: true }
📡 [RTVI Event] UserTranscript: { text: "hello", final: true }
```

**When Bot Responds:**
```
🤖 [Bot] Started speaking
🤖 [Bot Transcript]: { text: "Hello! I'm FloatChat..." }
📡 [RTVI Event] BotTranscript: { text: "Hello! I'm FloatChat..." }
🤖 [Bot] Stopped speaking
```

### Backend Logging (Terminal)

In `run_mvp.py` terminal, you'll see:

```
[Agno Agent Server] INFO Voice connect request for session: voice-1759330750
[Agno Agent Server] INFO Using pre-configured Daily room: https://...
[Agno Agent Server] INFO Starting bot subprocess for room: https://...
[Agno Agent Server] INFO Bot subprocess started with PID: 12345
[Agno Agent Server] INFO Created/using Daily room with meeting token

```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Start Backend

```bash
cd /Users/prada/Desktop/coding/SIH25
python run_mvp.py
```

Wait for:
```
✅ Voice bot is now listening for audio input...
```

### 2. Open Frontend

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or your frontend URL)
2. Open DevTools Console (F12)
3. Look for the Voice AI component

### 3. Start Voice Session

1. Click **"Start Voice AI"** button
2. Grant microphone permissions when browser prompts
3. Watch console for connection logs

**Expected Console Output:**
```
🎤 [Voice AI] Starting connection...
...
✅ [Pipecat] Bot is ready for conversation!
```

### 4. Test Speech Recognition

1. **Speak clearly**: "Hello"
2. **Watch for logs**:
   - `🎤 [User] Started speaking` - VAD detected your voice
   - `👤 [User Transcript]: ...` - STT recognized your speech
   - `🤖 [Bot] Started speaking` - Bot is responding

### 5. Test Language Switching

1. Click **"हिंदी में बदलें"** button
2. Speak in Hindi
3. Bot should respond in Hindi using Sarvam AI TTS

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### No "User Started Speaking" Log

**Problem**: VAD (Voice Activity Detection) not detecting your voice

**Solutions**:
1. Check microphone permissions in browser settings
2. Speak louder or closer to microphone
3. Adjust VAD threshold in `pipecat_bot.py:94`:
   ```python
   "threshold": 0.5,  # Lower = more sensitive (try 0.3)
   "min_volume": 0.6  # Lower = more sensitive (try 0.4)
   ```

### "User Started Speaking" But No Transcript

**Problem**: Soniox STT not processing audio

**Solutions**:
1. Check backend logs for STT errors
2. Verify `SONIOX_API_KEY` in `.env`
3. Check STT initialization logs: `🎤 Initializing Soniox STT...`

### Bot Not Responding

**Problem**: LLM or TTS failing

**Solutions**:
1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify `GROQ_API_KEY` and `SARVAM_API_KEY` in `.env`
3. Look for: `🧠 Initializing Groq LLM...` and `🔊 Initializing Sarvam AI TTS...`

### "Invalid Token" Warning

**Problem**: Daily.co authentication issue

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Backend now creates proper meeting tokens

**If still occurring**:
1. Check `DAILY_API_KEY` in `.env`
2. Check backend logs for token creation errors
3. Verify Daily.co API key is valid at https://dashboard.daily.co/

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Run the verification script before testing:

```bash
python verify_voice_setup.py
```

**Should show:**
- ✅ All API keys configured
- ✅ All files present
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Import paths correct

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

1. **Connection**: 2-3 seconds to connect to Daily room
2. **First Response**: Bot greets user immediately after connection
3. **Speech Detection**: VAD detects speech within 100-200ms
4. **STT Latency**: Transcript appears 500ms-1s after speaking
5. **Bot Response**: LLM response starts 1-2s after transcript
6. **TTS Playback**: Voice starts immediately after LLM response

## 🔄 Next Steps After Testing

If voice detection works:
- ✅ Test Hindi language switching
- ✅ Test interruption capability (speak while bot is talking)
- ✅ Test extended conversation (multiple turns)
- ✅ Test oceanographic queries about ARGO floats

If voice detection doesn't work:
- 📋 Share logs from browser console (all emoji-marked logs)
- 📋 Share logs from backend terminal (bot initialization section)
- 🔧 We'll adjust VAD threshold or investigate STT issues

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

All systems are configured and verified. The comprehensive logging will help us quickly identify any issues during testing.

**Start command**: `python run_mvp.py`

Good luck! 🎤🌊
