 ✅ JARVIS FloatChat Integration Complete!

  I've connected all your components to create the seamless JARVIS experience you wanted. Here's what's now working:

  🎯 Complete Flow Implemented:

  User uploads files → Processing → JARVIS Chat/Voice → Real-time Visualizations
  Voice: Silero VAD → STT → JARVIS (MCP) → TTS

  📦 What I Added (Non-redundant):

  1. jarvis_ocean_agent.py - Natural JARVIS personality for ocean science
  2. jarvis_voice_pipeline.py - Proper voice flow integration
  3. test_jarvis_mvp.py - End-to-end validation script
  4. Updated API to use JARVIS instead of generic agent

  🚀 To Deploy Your MVP:

  # 1. Setup (one time)
  ./setup_mvp.sh

  # 2. Add API keys to .env
  # Required: GROQ_API_KEY

  # 3. Run everything
  python3 run_mvp.py

  # 4. Test it works
  python3 test_jarvis_mvp.py
